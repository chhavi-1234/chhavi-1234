#  Multilevel Movie Genre Detection from Movie Screenshots

This project is an AI/ML-based system that automatically detects and classifies **multiple movie genres** by analyzing **movie screenshots** using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

Traditional genre classification relies heavily on textual metadata like title or description. This system introduces a **visual-based classification** approach using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect genres directly from movie frames or posters.

###  Key Features:
- Multi-label classification (each movie can belong to multiple genres)
- Trained on a dataset of movie screenshots and genre labels
- Image preprocessing and data augmentation
- Model built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Performance evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score


##  Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Google Colab (for training)


##  How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/chhavi-1234/MultiLevel-Movie-Genre-Detection.git

### 2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Run the notebook:
Open notebooks/main.ipynb in Jupyter or Colab

### 4. Upload images and get predictions of movie genres
